## 🚀 Project Overview
This project demonstrates the **full ML lifecycle** — from model training and evaluation to containerized deployment and CI/CD integration.

- Developed and benchmarked **CatBoost** classifier against other ML models.  
- Engineered meaningful features and handled class imbalance to maximize **recall** without compromising **precision**.  
- Built a **Flask-based API** for real-time predictions.  
- **Dockerized** the application for reproducible builds and local testing.  
- Deployed on **Render Cloud** with HTTPS, logs, and scalable environment.  
- Includes comprehensive documentation for one-command setup and deployment.
